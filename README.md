> Linux, Mac, Windows app for tracking, visualizing, and analyzing writing projects

Vislit is currently in development, shooting for a late 2021 release date for the earliest version. For more information:
[vislit.app](https://vislit.app/#/)

## Features

> Taking the best features of Microsoft Office, removing all the extraneous features, and giving writers only what's necessary

- Writing - from poems and short stories to hundreds of pages in length
- Notes - take notes and manage them
- Tracking - set goals and track progress
- Visualization - see goal progress with data visualizations
- Search - quickly search Merriam-Websters Collegiate Thesaurus and Dictionary and store words you'd like to use later in word collections
- Data privacy - your writing data is yours. The only time Vislit connects to the internet is when you search the thesaurus or dictionary. Export your writing data and store it any way you want.
