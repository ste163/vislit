# No longer in development
The project's scope was too large. Shifted efforts to a much smaller scoped writing application, [notes](https://github.com/ste163/notes)

# Vislit

> Multi-platform desktop app for writing, managing, tracking, visualizing, and analyzing writing projects

Vislit is currently in development. For more information: [vislit.app](https://vislit.app/#/)

## Features for v1.0

- Write - jot notes or write hundreds of pages
- Tracking - set multiple goals and track progress
- Visualization - visualize goal progress with charts
- Data privacy - Vislit only connects to the internet to check for updates from GitHub
- Export your writing data in `json` and `html`, so you're not "locked-in"

## Roadmap

- Search - quickly search Merriam-Websters Collegiate Thesaurus and Dictionary and store words you'd like to use later in word collections
- Multi-tiered goals based on categories. For example, "First Draft", "Second Draft", "Final Draft"
- Canvas view for placing notes and connecting lines (like sticky notes with light diagraming)
